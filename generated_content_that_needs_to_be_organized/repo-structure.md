# Core Content Template for Each Topic

Each topic directory should contain:

1. index.md - Topic overview
2. metaphors.md - Relevant metaphors and analogies
3. exercises/ - Practical exercises
4. resources/ - Topic-specific resources
5. next-steps.md - Links to related topics

# Linking Convention

- All technical terms should link to their glossary entries
- Each concept should link to its prerequisites
- Each topic should have "next step" suggestions
- Cross-referencing should be liberal but meaningful

# Key Principles

1. First Principles Thinking
   - Break down complex topics into fundamental truths
   - Build up from these fundamentals
   - Challenge assumptions

2. Metaphor-Based Learning
   - Each concept paired with familiar metaphors
   - Multiple metaphors for different learning styles
   - Real-world examples and applications

3. Progressive Disclosure
   - Basic concepts first
   - Gradual introduction of complexity
   - Clear prerequisites for each topic

4. Safety and Ethics Integration
   - Ethics considered in every topic
   - Safety implications discussed throughout
   - Responsible development practices

5. Human-AI Collaboration
   - Focus on complementary strengths
   - Develop critical thinking
   - Foster healthy skepticism

6. Intuition Development
   - Encourage pattern recognition
   - Support experiential learning
   - Value human insight

# Example Topic Structure (e.g., Context Windows)

```markdown
# Context Windows

## Intuitive Understanding
- Metaphor: A sliding glass door that shows only part of a landscape
- Metaphor: Short-term memory in conversations

## First Principles
- Why do we need context?
- How does memory work?
- Information processing limitations

## Technical Details
- Implementation examples
- Size considerations
- Performance implications

## Practical Applications
- Chat interfaces
- Document analysis
- Code completion

## Safety Considerations
- Privacy implications
- Memory manipulation risks
- Ethical considerations

## Exercises
1. Basic context window demonstration
2. Memory limitation experiments
3. Real-world application projects

## Next Steps
- Advanced context management
- Attention mechanisms
- Memory optimization
